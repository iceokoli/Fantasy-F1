# Fantasy-F1
The Objective is to come up Fantasy F1 team for the 2020 Formula 1 season and iterate on this week on week. The budget is Â£100 million, you have to have 4 drivers and 1 constructor. Furthermore you can only make one change a week aftr the first race.

I will be treating this as a Linear Programming and Discrete Optimisation problem in which I will be trying maximise an objective function under certain constraints.
